## 2025-07-07 - Lazy Loading Heavy Libraries in Extension Popups

**Learning:** Loading large libraries (like `html2pdf.js` ~885KB) synchronously in an extension popup's `popup.html` significantly delays the `DOMContentLoaded` and `Load` events, impacting the "Time to Interactive" (TTI) every time the user opens the extension. In this codebase, deferring these scripts until user interaction (clicking 'Export PDF' or 'Export to Notion') reduced initial load times by ~96%.

**Action:** Always check for heavy libraries in `popup.html` and implement a dynamic script loader (`loadScript`) for any dependencies that are only used in response to specific user actions.
